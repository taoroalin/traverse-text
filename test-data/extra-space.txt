Just copy entire memory from disk. Perhaps store screen to disk, display that first while rest of stuff is still copying. (my bios prints an image on boot pretty fast. When you shut down, just write the current screen to that exact place in memory) Some things have changed since you shut down, so you do need to do some work. Reconnect to internet, peripherals that could have been unplugged / the computer can function without. Code to do that should be copied first and started before everything finishes copying.
