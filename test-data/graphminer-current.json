I am already familiar with machine learning, and from books/talks/research papers I've read, AI safety research seems very appealing. I plan to get research experience in AI/ML soon, but I'm also curious if there's a cheaper way to test for personal fit for AI safety. A carreer in AI safety is very likely to fail and requires lots of education, but is intellectually stimulating. Software engineering (or similar) in a highly useful field like rationality tools is also very appealing, more achievable than AI safety, builds more flexible carreer capital, and could involve earning to give at the same time.

It is at best difficult and expensive to conduct controlled experiments on smoking status in the general population. The researcher may attempt to estimate the causal effect of smoking on health from observational data by using the tax rate for tobacco products as an instrument for smoking. The tax rate for tobacco products is a reasonable choice for an instrument because the researcher assumes that it can only be correlated with health through its effect on smoking. If the researcher then finds tobacco taxes and state of health to be correlated, this may be viewed as evidence that smoking causes changes in health.","create-time":1602967831714,"edit-time":1602967862856,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}}],"edit-time":1602967831717,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}}],"edit-time":1602947612394,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}},{"uid":"10-18-2020","title":"October 18th, 2020","children":[{"uid":"HFCoNfwPQ","string":"Reasons you might think human level AI soon is unlikely | Asya Bergal | EAGxVirtual 2020 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFJcvyxpGSo","create-time":1603071882234,"children":[{"uid":"bnJYk4oQj","string":"![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fgraphminer%2FHtRRm5iqxw.png?alt=media&token=955277bb-a9de-46c3-92a5-d23724a470a2)grace et al","create-time":1603071897729,"edit-time":1603071984872,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}},{"uid":"kC6ESjoAM","string":"recent increases in spending can't continue ","create-time":1603072674162,"edit-time":1603072683195,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}},{"uid":"c_KciBS5y","string":"Huge jump in talent doesn't necessarily mean more progress.

It would be reasonable for them to get 1-2 day global communication by physical transport.","create-time":1604002557821,"edit-time":1604003313645,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}}],"edit-time":1603988494202,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}},{"uid":"LHqfgfOng","string":"Is there an object that takes more than 3 points of support to hold up?","create-time":1603993167629,"edit-time":1603994098414,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}}],"edit-time":1603944005150,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}},{"uid":"SgXXQDj7t","create-time":1603991781028,"title":"1","edit-time":1603991781029,"children":[{"uid":"JlH9Q3W1L","string":"",":create/time":1614229956759,"children":[],":block/refs":[],":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}}],":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}},{"uid":"10-30-2020","title":"October 30th, 2020","children":[{"uid":"N1ZNvSDKo","string":"replace with arrow","create-time":1604076741532,"children":[{"uid":"RZlLedLye","string":"handle(.+)(\\(.+\\)) \\{","create-time":1604076746255,"edit-time":1604076747992,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}},{"uid":"xsTt_42Vy","string":"private handle$1=$2=>{","create-time":1604076748194,"edit-time":1604076756905,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}}],"edit-time":1604076746258,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}},{"uid":"bw4-ocaZi","string":"","create-time":1604103200710,"children":[{"uid":"KSdP1lyqZ","string":"What's the economic impact after 20 years (after the affected people can contribute to economy)","create-time":1604103199102,"edit-time":1604103241208,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}},{"uid":"jZp9pm9xV","string":"QALY cost effectiveness in those treated?","create-time":1604103241206,"edit-time":1604103269111,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}},{"uid":"i7PGdRluD","string":"Robustness of evidence, especially to changes in country","create-time":1604103256906,"edit-time":1604103282675,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}},{"uid":"tWiPIIf2l","string":"Global/random impact of work in these countries.

couldn’t believe how simple it was. I’ll tell you the main tricks here so you don’t have to waste a day in class.\r\n\r\nBusiness writing is about clarity and persuasion. The main technique is keeping things simple. Simple writing is persuasive. A good argument in five sentences will sway more people than a brilliant argument in a hundred sentences. Don’t fight it.\r\n\r\nSimple means getting rid of extra words. Don’t write, “He was very happy” when you can write “He was happy.” You think the word “very” adds something. It doesn’t. Prune your sentences.\r\n\r\nHumor writing is a lot like business writing. It needs to be simple. The main difference is in the choice of words. For humor, don’t say “drink” when you can say “swill.”\r\n\r\nYour first sentence needs to grab the reader. Go back and read my first sentence to this post. I rewrote it a dozen times. It makes you curious. That’s the key.\r\n\r\nWrite short sentences. Avoid putting multiple thoughts in one sentence. Readers aren’t as smart as you’d think.\r\n\r\nLearn how brains organize ideas. Readers comprehend “the boy hit the ball” quicker than “the ball was hit by the boy.” Both sentences mean the same, but it’s easier to imagine the object (the boy) before the action (the hitting). All brains work that way. (Notice I didn’t say, “That is the way all brains work”?)\r\n\r\nThat’s it. You just learned 80% of the rules of good writing.

There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.”This paradox rests on the most elementary common sense. The gate or fence did not grow there. It was not set up by somnambulists who built it in their sleep. It is highly improbable that it was put there by escaped lunatics who were for some reason loose in the street. Some person had some reason for thinking it would be a good thing for somebody. And until we know what the reason was, we really cannot judge whether the reason was reasonable. It is extremely probable that we have overlooked some whole aspect of the question, if something set up by human beings like ourselves seems to be entirely meaningless and mysterious. There are reformers who get over this difficulty by assuming that all their fathers were fools; but if that be so, we can only say that folly appears to be a hereditary disease. But the truth is that nobody has any business to destroy a social institution until he has really seen it as an historical institution. If he knows how it arose, and what purposes it was supposed to serve, he may really be able to say that they were bad purposes, that they have since become bad purposes, or that they are purposes which are no longer served. But if he simply stares at the thing as a senseless monstrosity that has somehow sprung up in his path, it is he and not the traditionalist who is suffering from an illusion.__","create-time":1607484254948,"edit-time":1607484255627,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}}],"refs":[{"uid":"EHC-fi40n"}],":block/refs":[{":block/uid":"EHC-fi40n"}],"string":"[[Chesterton]] His writing is good!","create-time":1607484245636,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}}],"refs":[{"uid":"A5sBbulNQ"}],":block/refs":[{":block/uid":"A5sBbulNQ"}],"string":"[[Read]] https://fireflydove.wordpress.com/2009/10/12/a-libertarian-view-of-gay-marriage/","create-time":1607480236076,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}},{"uid":"L4DAGEwbl","string":"[[logseq]][[Blogs]]https://logseq.github.io/page/Changelog","create-time":1607480240697,":block/refs":[{":block/uid":"u9aVElWOV"},{":block/uid":"OhA51vTZY"}],"refs":[{"uid":"u9aVElWOV"},{"uid":"OhA51vTZY"}],"edit-time":1607481549428,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}},{"uid":"9y2tjG2ap","string":"#DigiKey","create-time":1607443126109,":block/refs":[{":block/uid":"se9FR8_Nb"}],"refs":[{"uid":"se9FR8_Nb"}],"edit-time":1607443310764,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}},{"uid":"GAJ0-cWqI","edit-time":1607444185703,"children":[{"uid":"akKu5MeRv","string":" Does it have no persistant index? how does it query fast?","create-time":1607444145961,"edit-time":1607444185707,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}},{"uid":"dORL8LzJk","string":"Why does it use ocaml for parsing? what are the tradeoffs?","create-time":1607444205224,"edit-time":1607444223668,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}},{"uid":"JQANgzo3N","string":"How good is their parser?","create-time":1607444225339,"edit-time":1607444232838,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}}],"refs":[{"uid":"OhA51vTZY"}],":block/refs":[{":block/uid":"OhA51vTZY"}],"string":"[[logseq]] engineering","create-time":1607444185704,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}},{"uid":"mNP1aSjG3","string":"[[Storybook]] t shows top menu with docs","create-time":1607444180165,":block/refs":[{":block/uid":"X2DrV6F3X"}],"refs":[{"uid":"X2DrV6F3X"}],"edit-time":1607444748637,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}},{"uid":"6pJQ3xWtx","edit-time":1607458250395,"children":[{"uid":"Kw2uQeYW1","string":"AI safety, as currently thought of, would be irrelevent","create-time":1607458250393,"edit-time":1607458269162,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}},{"uid":"t7FyoczzB","string":"Motives for aliens","create-time":1607458269159,"children":[{"uid":"USgRLtr5w","string":"Science","create-time":1607458279046,"edit-time":1607458281384,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}},{"uid":"eQud4wXj3","string":"Tourism / media creation","create-time":1607458281376,"edit-time":1607458289419,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}},{"uid":"G8mmZX9e9","string":"Military spying","create-time":1607458289416,"edit-time":1607458302678,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}}],"edit-time":1607458279049,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}},{"uid":"IoJVIJFt9","string":"Size of alien civilization: if there's one already here, then I would guess aliens control most of galaxy.

Just by looking around because the book was kinda like well, it's actually it's actually good to to orient your map based on looking around and then you could like confirm with your compass that you've done it right. But no, she didn't seem to get it which I think either means that she is very spatially aware and like doesn't need to have the map properly the map oriented in order to use it or, or she just doesn't really get it.

So we're orienting up every time like I'm sort of a lot of times saying or getting mad every time we you know, you're sort of stopped or a map. And Claire said okay, here's a map to put you know that you have like the dial. She's she had this stuff with the dial. So you turn the dial. Like I never really understood take like you don't need to turn the dial like or anything when you just look at the needle, you don't do anything with the dial. But she was doing something with a dial and I don't know what I still don't know I've been kind of struggling over that. Whether it's just like sort of a weakness thing. Like you want to have your dials pointing towards north. You want to line up north with the arrow and they sweat baseplate just so it's sort of Meteor that way or like a way of kind of just having it be random. That's I think that would be the most reasonable in the last couple of days. You have this, I think that would be the most reasonable thing. explanation that maybe just this always orient, orienting the dial. So that north winds up it just makes it.

What does it all mean?\n\nIn this talk I explain how we can meaningfully address these questions with the frame of \"consciousness vs. pure replicators\". This framework allows us to re-interpret and unify all previous \"scales of moral/conceptual development\". In turn, it makes solving disagreements in a principled way possible. \n\n\"Consciousness vs. Pure Replicators\" is what I call \"the universal plot of reality\"; it is the highest level of narrative that determines what is \"relevant to the plot\" at any given point in time.\n\nWhether consciousness succeeds at gaining control of its destiny and embarks on a collective journey of self-authorship, or whether we all end up being subservient cogs to a self-replicating mega-system whose one and only utility function is to self-perpetuate, is truly up in the air right now. So what can we do to support the interests of consciousness, then?\n\nTo aid consciousness we need more than good intentions (though those are still a key ingredient): I discuss how game theoretical considerations entail that in order for consciousness to succeed we will need to judiciously ally with specific replicator strategies. Being a \"cooperatebot\" towards anyone who claims to care about consciousness makes you liable to being resource-pumped. You need to verify that something makes sense also from the point of view of game theory; without a way to verify the ultimate values of others, coordinating with them at this level becomes extremely challenging. I suggest that a mature technology of intelligent bliss with objectively verifiable effects would be a game-changer. Once you've seen \"it\" (i.e. optimized bliss consciousness) you join everyone else in self-organizing around it.\n\nIf the world is to be taken over by something that cares about the wellbeing of consciousness, how this taking over process looks like may blindside us all. The power of \"universal love\" conquering all obstacles and creating a paradise for all may not be a New Age fantasy after all. Given the appropriate technology, it may turn out to be a live option...\n\nTopics covered: Kegan Levels of Development, Spiral Dynamics, Model of Hierarchical Complexity, Meta-Modernism, Qualia Formalism, Valence Structuralism, Pleasure Principle, Open Individualism, Universal Darwinism, Battle Between Good and Evil, Balance Between Good and Evil, Gradients of Wisdom, Consciousness vs. Pure Replicators, Wild Animal Suffering, Mistrusting DMT Entities, Super-Cooperator Cluster, Metta/Lovingkindness, State-Dependent Sexuality, Wireheading, Cooperation Technology, Game-Changing as a Strategy.\n\nQualia of the Day: Kala Namak\n\n\n","create-time":1610470127774,"edit-time":1610470127774,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}},{"uid":"2peD79Li1","string":"Further readings:","create-time":1610476672497,"children":[{"uid":"jcTmkDD2S","edit-time":1610484177190,"children":[{"uid":"lTBaZ8psj","string":"\" in 2009, researchers transplanted such genes to mice and heard them make more intere­sting squeaks\" I feel like I would need very quantitative evidence to believe this, given things like Koko.","create-time":1610484226401,"edit-time":1610484252295,":create/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"DRFLjAAyWmePdBYNYD6ZDxbSfDm1"}},{"uid":"h-Ogmsn29","string":"\n\nSpiral Dynamics & Integral Theory -
