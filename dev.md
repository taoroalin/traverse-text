# How to get started developing Traverse Text

Use text wrap in your editor. This codebase is made using text wrap, and you will have a very hard time reading the code otherwise.

Clone on an Ubuntu machine, then run `./start-fresh.sh`. This will create empty data folders, install nodejs and (optional) npm dependencies, and start the site and API servers. If all goes well the site will be up on `localhost:8081`. Whenever you change the code, you can reload the page to see the changes. Otherwise it's up to you to read and debug the script.
